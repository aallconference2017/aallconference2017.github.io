Many of these changes are the result of varying and sometimes conflicting demands from Government, our own institutions, our faculties/units, colleagues and students.&nbsp; What is our identity when we&rsquo;re asked what we&rsquo;re doing for international students, pathway students, low SES students, students studying on-line, Higher Degree students to name a few, and how are we contributing to curriculum development and staff capacity building?&nbsp; How can we define our current practice and is it important to do so?&nbsp;</p><p>The focus of this stream would be:</p><ul><li><p>How we see ourselves as ALL practitioners (collaboratively or otherwise)</p></li><li><p>The changes which drive current and future ALL practice</p></li><li><p>The theories which help inform ALL practice&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How the process of (critical) self-reflection has helped enhance our professional practice<strong></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="section1">ALL for diversity and inclusivity<strong><u> </u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></h3><p>It is now expected that universities are characterised by culturally and linguistically diverse students. Whether Indigenous, low SES, refugee, EAL, or a combination, non traditional cohorts of students are supported by policies and programs that attempt to redress the imbalance in access and educational readiness. This stream calls for papers that critically discuss and reflect on the provision of ALL programs and resources which address such diversity, scrutinise their effectiveness and question the frameworks that underpin such programs.</p><p>The focus of this stream would be: &nbsp;<em></em></p><ul><li><p>To what extent are our current thinking and practices around student diversity reflecting good practice / social and educational expectations / educational imperatives?</p></li><li><p>What innovations are being implemented? How is their effectiveness determined?</p></li><li><p>How can support services be made more useful for these students (and others not included above)?</p></li><li><p>How are we developing our own and our students&rsquo; cultural competence to ensure our programs do in fact address the imbalances described above? <em></em><strong></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="section2">â€‹Digitalising ALL practices</h3><p>This stream calls for papers that critically discuss and reflect on ALL programs and resources operating wholly or partly in the digital space. While research suggests that some online students are at risk of becoming disengaged from the university community, there is also evidence to suggest that digital resources and communication tools afford students new and exciting opportunities to engage and connect online. The push to online learning can create considerable tension among different stakeholders. For example, management may see the potential of online learning in terms of governance and control or to reach more students whereas faculty are concerned with how online technologies can create pedagogies that serve current students better.</p><p>Key questions related to this stream might include:</p><ul><li><p>How can existing ALL programs adapt to / adopt new digital formats while maintaining the integrity of the message and continuing to make meaningful connections with students?</p></li><li><p>How do our ALL programs/resources complement other areas of the university (e.g. Faculties, Library, International Support, Transition and Orientation)? How is this complementarity developed through our collaborative experiences?</p></li><li><p>How might digital ALL resources/services open up new opportunities to collaborate across the university?</p></li><li><p>What are the changing expectations of our new students, the so-called &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo;? Or, do online technologies serve high achieving students better than low achieving students and as such reproduce systemic injustices?</p></li><li><p>What are some of the challenges and opportunities we face in maintaining digital resources, upskilling staff, and bringing staff along the journey?<strong></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="section3">Innovations in Peer Learning</h3><p>ALL colleagues are increasingly involved in student peer learning programs either as leaders of these programs or as close associates. This is an opportunity to share what&rsquo;s new in peer learning for your campus or institution or to demonstrate how you have benefited from or changed a long standing program and why. Innovations might be related to program design, program leadership, student cohort, student learning within a program or discipline, student roles or evaluation.</p><p>Some questions to explore could be:</p><ul><li><p>Why is there a need for your innovation and how has it helped improve student learning or other elements related to student success?</p></li><li><p>What gap(s) has your peer learning innovation attempted to fill or aimed to complement?</p></li><li><p>What are the challenges and how are you trying to overcome them? How have you &nbsp;succeeded?</p></li><li><p>How have students and staff responded to these innovation(s)?</p></li><li><p>How sustainable is your innovation? Is it a short term innovation to meet an immediate need or do you anticipate a longer time frame?</p></li><li><p>Where ALL staff do not have responsibility for / relationships with student peer mentoring, how can inroads be made?</p></li></ul><h3 id="section4">Research and Evaluation</h3><p>This theme explores possibilities and constraints around research and evaluation in the field of ALL. In recent years, ALL practitioners have been increasingly taking a pivotal role in the partnerships between faculty, staff and students to support the development of successful and engaged learning communities. However, the experience and depth of knowledge (including discipline and linguistic expertise) that ALL members contribute to universities is not always recognised by other university stakeholders or made sufficiently visible in educational policies. Educational research and evaluation require time and the gathering of reliable and accurate information. In a climate where universities are pressured to minimise costs, we must increasingly rely on measurement, statistical data and competitive comparisons to inform educational policy. We are collecting ever larger quantities of data about performance and experiences of students, but is this bringing us any closer to answering the question of what makes education meaningful / useful? This theme invites critical and innovative contributions on research and evaluation in ALL.</p><p>Areas for discussion can include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>Research and evaluative processes are meant to be about the improvement of quality. How do we define &lsquo;quality&rsquo;? Whose definition of quality do we accept?</p></li><li><p>What are the ontological and epistemological understandings that inform our research and evaluative practices?</p></li><li><p>Do the epistemologies underpinning our work embrace non-Western perspectives?</p></li><li><p>What are the educational spaces we wish to re-claim (e.g. evidence-based or value-based)?<strong></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="section5">Partnerships in action</h3><p>ALL units are placed in various structural positions on institutional organisation charts. They also have slightly differing foci.&nbsp; Regardless, our roles inevitably involve collaborations and partnerships. Your partnerships may include Faculty, Library, Careers, Centres for Teaching and Learning, International Office, Graduate Research units, pre-uni programs and/or community organisations. With appropriate data at hand sometimes ALL colleagues can drive these partnerships, however often we are hampered by silo mentalities and competitive spirits.&nbsp; We invite you to present on your experiences, lessons learnt and possible future transformations of partnerships.</p><p>Key questions include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>What innovative approaches have you used to build and develop partnerships? How have you negotiated complex partnerships?</p></li><li><p>How can partnerships be made more robust?</p></li><li><p>How are partnerships changing the academic identities of staff and students (undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral)?</p></li><li><p>How are workplace, discipline or professional differences understood and navigated in our collaborative work?</p></li></ul></div>
